Purpose: Scale Invariant Interest Point Detectors, Local Descriptors

They are used in the paper:
	Gy. Dorkó and C. Schmid
	Selection of Scale Invariant Neighborhoods for Object Class Recognition 9th International Conference on Computer Vision , 2003.
	(http://www.inrialpes.fr/lear/people/dorko/pub.html)

This archive contains the following binaries:
	Detect - Scale invariant interest point detection
	ComputeDescriptor - computing local descriptors
	DrawCorners - Show the result on the image
	dumpcontents - convert the result to ascii text
	hldesc - print the descriptors (obsolete in favor of corners2text)
	corners2matlab-r12 and corners2matlab-r13 - convert the result to matlab format
	corners2text - convert detected points/descriptors to text
	MergeCorners - merge detected files
	SelectCorners - select some descriptors from the binary files
	text2corners - convert text files to the input format of ComputeDescriptor
	ipld.changelog.txt - changes to the archive
	ipld.readme.txt - this readme file

General binary information:
	Most of them: 
		ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, statically linked
		Shortly: If you have a pc with Linux installed they should all work.

	corners2matlab-xx
		ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped
		Dynamically linked libraries:
        linux-gate.so.1
        libmx.so
        libut.so
        libmat.so
        libmi.so
        libstdc++.so.6
        libm.so.6
        libgcc_s.so.1
        libc.so.6
        libstdc++-libc6.1-2.so.3
        libdl.so.2
        libpthread.so.0
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2

		You must have all of these to run the matlab conversation tool. (Don't
		forget to set you LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable if it is necessary.)
		Shortly: You should not have any problem if gcc 3.x and MatLab installed on your system.
		You may need to get libstdc++-libc6.1-2.so.3 from somewhere (matlab libs use it).
		Note that there are 2 matlab conversion utility corners2matlab-r12 and corners2matlab-r13
		If you have a different version try to use corners2text and load the text file in matlab.
	
For general help and available options please run the appropriate binary with -help option.
