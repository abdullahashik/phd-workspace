02/11/2005
	- added option -unnormalized (ComputeDescriptor)

05/09/2005
	- bugfix in SIFT computation (ComputeDescriptor)

22/08/2005:
	- Harris-Laplace
		- new implementation, faster and better
		- subpixel
		- for backward compatibility old implementation still available via -old
		- still in a bit beta state, but added option -scalestep
		- no scale selection to get multi-scale representation
	- Added detector: dense 
	  	- defines a multiscale dense grid instead of detection points (useful e.g. for dense texture representation)
	- Affine computation
	  	- faster, better
		- for backward compatibility old implementation still available via -old
		- a_xxx options do not work anymore
	- Angle computation
	  	- different implementation, now it is only a gradient in the center (faster, better with Harris-Laplace).
		- for backward compatibility old implementation still available via -old
	- SIFT
	  	- new implementation from almost scratch: faster better
		- new options, more control on computation (window size, number of cells/bins)
		- for backward compatibility old implementation still available via -old
		- the default parameters for the new implementation are set to resemble as much as possible the old one.
	- Added representation: spin (Spin-Images)
	- Image I/O completely replaced with new implementation.

16/06/2004:
	- New detectors: DoG, LoG
	- New descriptor: SIFT
	- Some bug fixes
	- User's Guide separately available

15/01/2004:
	- Static binaries
	- ImageMagick (dynamically linked) binaries still included

13/06/2003: 
	- Better affine estimation
	- Corrected bugs (frozen load/store)
	- Detect can be run on several files (specifying a list file)
	- Added DISPLAY feature to DrawCorners and Detect -ma

31/03/2003: Initial version
